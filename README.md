💼 **What I Do:**  
I'm a Staff Researcher at [Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), leading applied machine learning projects across multiple domains: real-time forecasting of patient risk 🏥, battlefield triage 🔺, radiation detection ☢️, robotics 🤖, nuclear physics :atom:, hyperspectral imaging for geophysics 🛰️, computational chemistry 🧪, and radio frequency signal processing 📡. These are all active projects I'm directly responsible for. They just happen to span across disciplines.

🛠 **Coding Interests:**  
Experienced with Python, C++, and JavaScript/TypeScript. Enthusiast of Linux and VS Code (with vim bindings, of course 🥸). Lately, I've been exploring [Polars](https://pola.rs/) for efficient DataFrame operations, [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) for accelerating numerical computing, and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python environments.

🎓 **Education:**  
Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), with research conducted at the [National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL)](https://nscl.msu.edu/), now known as the [Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB)](https://frib.msu.edu/). It is home to the world's 🌎 most powerful heavy-ion accelerator for rare isotope science!

🧠 **External Brain:**  
I share code snippets and technical notes on my Gist page, which I frequently refer to myself: <a href="https://gist.github.com/fanurs"><img src="svg_files/github.svg"><img src="svg_files/gist.svg"></a>

🤝 **Collaboration Welcome:**  
If you think there's something where your domain expertise 🤯 could benefit from machine learning, reach out 🤙! [Our lab](https://autonlab.org/) is deeply interested in interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and we've spent decades working with partners from the industry, academia, and government.

🔗 **Let's Connect:**  
If you're interested in collaboration or discussions about science, software, or AI, feel free to reach out.

### 📁 About My Personal Repositories

I used to publish more personal projects here, but most of my current work involves larger collaborations that are not yet open source 😿. I hope to share some of these projects in the near future, pending internal reviews or publication.
